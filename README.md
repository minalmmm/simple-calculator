Work on project- SIMPLE CALCULATOR

The goal of this project is to design a simple and basic calculator. With the help of Python programming language, to make a basic calculator and perform arithmetic operations on it. I used Tkinter GUI library of Pythonto design our user- interface as itis one of the most useful and easiest ways for developing GUI applications because Tkinter works well in both Linux and Windows platforms. My Project basically have two main things: •Building UI (Front-end) •Write Python Code (Back-end) The project contains the numbers, operators, and sign like in normal calculator. So, the user can enter any number or can just click on the numbers they want in the calculations. Hence, the user can use a simple calculator from this application. The project file contains a python script (calculator.py). This is a simple GUI-base project which is very easy to understand and use. Also, this project makes a convenient way for the user to gain an idea of how to perform number calculations.

About system: This simple project is in Python. Talking about the features of this system, this python application is designed to calculate entered numbers to any operations and it is also capable of handling all types of exceptions. Also, the design of this system is pretty simple so that the user won’t get any difficulties while working on it.

Calculator algorithm:

Initialise the two numbers.
Ask the user to enter an option.
After receiving the user’s option, create if conditions for each operation based on the option.
Carry out the required action.
Print the result.
What is Tkinter? Python offers various utilities to design the GUI wiz Graphical User Interface, and one such utility is Tkinter which is most commonly used. It is indeed one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI application.

How to Implement: Step 1: Importing the necessary modules Step 2: Making a window for our calculator Step 3: Designing the buttons Step 4: Mapping the buttons to their functionalities In this calculator program in python, the “Entry” function helps in making a text input field and I use .grid() method to define the positioning associated with the button or input field. i have use the button method to display a button on my application window. root – the name with which we refer to our window text – text to be displayed on the button row – row index of the grid column – column index of the grid columnspan – spans or combines the number of columns sticky – If the resulting cell is larger than the widget then sticky defines how to expand the widget.

conclusion - I have successfully designed a python calculator with tkinter. This project helps to all the user to perform the mathematical operations very easily. The proposed system is error free.
